#summary Build Instructions.

= Build Instructions =

This service is built on top of xmlrpc-c, you can either get that through your distro repository, download from their sourceforge page, or check out from their repository. I compile against their 'advanced' branch, which is version 1.24.0 at the moment. Follow their instructions on how to install their stuff.

After you check my source out, you should first try 'which xmlrpc-c-config' and make sure that's the one you want to use. If there isn't one, you should either add its location to your PATH or you can edit it in manually in drmaa-xmlrpc/makefile. You'll also need your scheduler's DRMAA implementation, get it from them and either tweak drmaa-xmlrpc/makefile so that it'll find the headers and library or put them in places where it'll find them. After that you can run 'make all' at the top level and you should have an executable drmaa-xmlrpc/drmaa-xmlrpc. There should also be a sample conf file. By default it'll look for that filename in the current working directory or override that with 'drmaa-xmlrpc --conf-file /path/to/your/conf-file'. Configuration file support is in its infancy, as such there's no support for comments or empty lines or anything like that. There's no support for spaces inside string values. Break those rules and behavior is undetermined.
