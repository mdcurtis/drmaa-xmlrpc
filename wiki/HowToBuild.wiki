#summary Build Instructions.

= Build Instructions =

One of these days I'll figure out a better way to do this, but for now this build is tailored to how I like things on my dev system at the moment.

= Details =

This is how it works at the moment:
<li>The makefiles can do 'all', 'clean', and 'install'
<li>Dependencies of sub-folders is foreach depends on nothing; config depends on foreach; drmaa-xmlrpc depends on config, xmlrpc-c, and libdrmaa
<li>'make install' at the top level will first put foreach and config headers and static libraries into ~/include and ~/lib respectively. config will look for foreach stuff there, so if you just create those folders it should get you this far. After that it will try to compile drmaa-xmlrpc and put the executable in ~/bin. For this step to succeed, you will need:
<br>a) xmlrpc-c in some way, whether you just get it from your repository or download a specific version, once you have it you should have xmlrpc-c-config executable somewhere on your system, you can edit drmaa-xmlrpc/makefile and set XMLRPC_C_CONFIG variable to its location
<br>and b) libdrmaa, you can compile everything without actually having something like SGE on the machine, just libdrmaa-dev from your repository. It won't work because drmaa_init() will fail, but it should compile and run, setting log_mask = -1 and log_file = /path/to/file should execute and spit out the drmaa_init failure to the log file. ===
